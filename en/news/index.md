# 2017

## August

Tamás and Attila finish registering the foundation. The team drafts the logo
and the stamp, deploys the very first version of the website, and starts the
charity vetting process with TechSoup and Benevity. We enter into a bookkeeping
agreement with Prima Nota.

Our Slack channels become more active as we start brainstorming about possible
projects.

## July

Hermina and Attila visit their hometowns in Serbia.

During their stay, they meet with Tamás and Gábor. Tamás agrees to join the
team as the administrator and legal representative of the foundation. Gábor
joines as the third board member.

The team decides on the name and legal form, and drafts the goals and potential
activities of the organisation.

The founders construct the statute and the rest of the founding documents, and
begin the process of registering the foundation.
