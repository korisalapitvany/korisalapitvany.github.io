<div id="introduction" class="mdl-color--green-300 introduction" markdown="1">
**Ash Foundation for Environmental Protection** is a nonprofit,
non-governmental organization based in Serbia.

As an environmental organization we aim to **promote and enhance nature
protection** and to **reconstruct, restore and revitalize habitats** that are
crucial to a balanced flora and fauna. We are **reaching out to the community**
to invite the people living in the area to change their habits to achieve
**sustainable use** and conservation of natural resources and improve the
management of waste materials.

All of these are substantial to us, however, the backbone of Ash Foundation is
our determination to inform and educate the general public, **especially
children and youth**, of the importance of preserving and protecting the
environment and nature.
